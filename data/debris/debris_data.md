# Debris Data Collection Period and Scope

## Context and Reference to Analysis Background

As established in the Analysis Background, the YPSAT collision avoidance system is designed to operate as a  conitinuous conjuction analysis function throughout the mission lifetime, with all analytical processes intialized at a defined epoch of 21 March 2025.

In alignment with this framework, the collection of space debris and resident space object (RSO) data is structured to support: 

- Initialization of the conjuction analysis at the chosen epoch, and
- Sustained assessment of the orbital collision environment during early mission operations.

## Debris Data Collection Timeframe

For the purpose of conjuction analysis and system evaluation, debris data are collected over the following period:

- Data Collection Start: March 2025
- Data Collection End: January 2026

This interval spans from the period immediately following YPSAT's orbital stabilization through the start of the subsequent calender year, ensuring coverage of both the initial operational phase and extended on-orbit conditions.

## Scope of Debris Data

The debris dataset collected during this period includes:

- Catalogued resident sapce objects (RSOs) in low Earth orbit, including:

    - Defunct satellites
    - Fragmentation debris
    - Upper stages and mission-related objects

- Orbital elements and state information suitable for conjuction screening and propagation.

- Objects whose orbital regimes intersect or approach YPSAT's operational altitude and inclination.

Only objects meeting predefined altitude, inclination, and proximity screening criteria are consudered for detailed conjuction assessment.
