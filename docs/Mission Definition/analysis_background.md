# Analysis Background

This document tells about the launch and deployment of the YPSAT. The duration of conjucton analysis and the implementation of aboidance maneuver.

## Launch and Orbital Deployment Timeline

The YPSAT (Yield and Planning Satellite) mission is scheduled for launch aboard a PSLV-class launch vehicle in November 2025. Following launch, the satellite will undergo Early Orbit Phase (EOP) and Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) activities, including orbit injection verification, attitude acquisition, subsystem health checks, and establishment of reliable communication with the ground segment.

By December 2025, YPSAT is expected to be stabilized in its designated low Earth orbit, following completion of orbit correction maneuvers, precise orbit determination initialization, and payload and navigation subsystem calibration.

## Definition of Analysis Epoch

To ensure stable orbital parameters and reliable satte estimation, a short post-commisioning period is allocated before initiating conjuction analysis operations. The eopch for conjuction analysis is defined as 21 December 2025, marking the formal start of collision assessment activities.


All orbital sate vectors, propagation, and conjuction evaluations in this study are referenced to this epoch unless otherwise stated.
