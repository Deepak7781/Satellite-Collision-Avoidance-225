# The Problem Statement

A imaginary yet realistic problem statements which leads us to the mission definition.

## The Challenge

Tamil Nadu, One of India's most agriculturally and economically significant states, is increasingly vulnerable to hydro-climati extremes and unplanned urbanization. River systems such as the Vaigai and Kaveri, which traditionally sustain large-scale paddy cultivation and coastal livelihoods, are now subject to severe seasonal variability.

In recent years, this variability has maifeted as:

- Severe flooding (e.g., 2024), inundating more than 500 villages and causing economic losses exceeding ₹10,000 crore across agriculture, housing, and infrastructure.

- Prolonged drought conditions (e.g., 2023), resulting in yield reductions of approximately 25% in delta regions, increasing farmer distress and socio-economic instability.

- Rapid urban expansion, particularly around Chennai, leading to large-scale wetland encroachment, obstruction of natural drainage pathways, intensification of urbam heat islands (temperatures exceeding 45 $\degree C$) and the proliferation of unauthorized developments.

Effective disaster response and long-term planning are constrained by inadequate  and delayed geospatial information. Ground-based surveys are time consuming and limited in coverage, while existing satellite datasets often suffer from:

- Insufficient spatial resolution ($\approx 2 - 2.5 \text{ m}$) to detect localized infrastructure failures sucha s embankement breaches.

- Low temperol resolution, with revisit times of several days.

- Cloud over limitations, especially during monsoon periods.

These limitations result in delayed evacuations, inefficient allocation of relief resources, and inadequate eqrly warning capabilities for farmers and local administrations.

## The Gap

While national Earth observation missions such as ISRO's Cartosat-2 series have provided valuable geospatial data, they are optimized for broad national scale monitoring rather than high-frequency hyper-local observation. Their operational constraints include:

- Limited revisit frequency over specific regions
- Restricted tasking flexibility
- Data dissemination pipelines that do not adequately support near-real-time decision-making at district or panchayat levels.

Currently, there is no dedicated, low-cost, high-resolution Earth observation platform tailored specifically to:

- Rapid flood extent and progression mapping at sub-meter scale
- Fine-scale urban growth and wetland encroachment monitoring
- Agriculture decision support thriugh timely vegetation condition assessment
- Direct integration of satellite-derived indights into loacal governance and disaster response workflows

As a result, significant public expenditure continues to be directed toward post-disaster response rather than risk anticipation and mitigation.
