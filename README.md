# Solution to MATLAB and Simulink Challenge project 225 -Satellite Collision Avoidance

### Problem Statement

The satellite industry is experiencing unprecedented growth, with new companies launching record numbers of satellites transforming global communication, providing near real-time images of our planet, and even enabling commercial space tourism.

As more and more satellites are added to low Earth orbit, the probability of collisions between satellites and orbital debris continues to rise. This is compounded by the fact that any collisions that do occur (either between operational satellites and debris or two pieces of debris) create more space debris on impact. Satellites and orbital debris travel at orbital speeds greater than 17,500 mph (7825 m/s) in low earth orbit. At these speeds, even relatively small orbital debris can cause substantial to catastrophic damage to a satellite or a spacecraft if a collision occurs.
